            <h2>About</h2>
<p>Greetings! I'm a Master student at SungKyunKwan University in Human Language Intelligence Lab. I'm particularly interested in <strong>how languages vary among different communties</strong>, as (online) communities grow in a world-scale. That's why my research mainly focuses on <strong>specialized vocabulary for social groups in Neural Machine Translation</strong>. Inspired by this research and recent advance in large language models, now I am also curious on how user-centered design of AI product can change usability for online users, whose needs are various. </p>
<p>My journey into this fascinating field has been shaped by a rather unique and diverse background: With a Bachelor's degree in Confucian Studies and Eastern Philosophy, I delved into the profound philosophies that have shaped societies for centuries. Alongside, I also delved into subjects seemingly unrelated yet equally intriguing, such as Construction and Landscape Architecture designing. <strong>The multitude of lexicons, nuances, and meanings woven into these diverse communities captured my interest in linguistic diversity, ultimately guiding me to the captivating NLP.</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions or would like to know about me XD, please contact me! I'm always happy to connect with others who share my interests! :D </p>
